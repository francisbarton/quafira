# quafira
A personalised Quarto HTML document template using Fira Sans and with nice support for gt tables and ggplot2 charts.

I'm planning to use [firasans.kit](https://github.com/dnordstrom/firasans.kit) by dnordstrom.

I think [bookup-html](https://github.com/juba/bookup-html) by juba is quite close to what I want to achieve.

I'm hoping to build in some good CSS defaults that will apply to [{gt}](https://gt.rstudio.com/) tables even when toggling between light and dark modes.

I want to write a custom R function that will generate and open up a quarto template using this custom format when I run it.
I'm tired of copying and pasting YAML and other setup boilerplate from qmd file to qmd file.
